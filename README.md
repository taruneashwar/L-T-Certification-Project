Aim: 
To develop a prototype moving structure which can cut grass overheads in a grass yard. (Automatic Grass cutting Robot).

Result: 
On running the simulation on TinkerCad, we can see the current status on the Serial Monitor, indicating the distance of the obstacle from the robot and whether the grass is getting cut. At the same time, the motor RPM and its changes can be observed in the circuit.
When the obstacle is more than 20cm away from the robot, the Serial Monitor displays “Grass is getting cut!” along with its distance while the motors spin too.
When the obstacle is less than 20cm away from the robot, the Serial Monitor displays “Object nearby, stopped cutting grass! Robot is avoiding object” along with its distance while the motor connected to the blade for cutting the grass stops until the distance between the object and robot is 20cm away again.
